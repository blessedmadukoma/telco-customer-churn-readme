# telco-customer-churn-readme
This project aims to predict customer churn and segment the customer base for a telecommunications company using machine learning and data analysis techniques. By analyzing historical customer data, we develop models to predict which customers are most likely to leave the service, enabling the company to take proactive measures to retain them.
